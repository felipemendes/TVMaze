## MVVM Architecture

### Structure:

1. **View (SwiftUI View)**
- Responsible for presenting the UI.
- Binds to the *ViewModel* to display data and send user actions.

2. **ViewModel**
- Connected below the *View* in the diagram.
- Has a bidirectional connection to the *View* (via *@Published* properties in the *ViewModel* and *@ObservedObject* or *@StateObject* in the *View* for data binding).
- Handles business logic and prepares data for display.
- Communicates with the **Model** to retrieve or update data.

3. **Model**
- Positioned at the bottom layer in the diagram.
- Connected to the *ViewModel*, indicating that the *ViewModel* can access or modify the Model.

### Relationships

1. **View <-> ViewModel**
- The *View* observes changes in the *ViewModel* through data binding.
- The *ViewModel* updates its properties based on user actions forwarded from the *View*, and these changes are reflected back in the *View*.

2. **ViewModel -> Model**
- The *ViewModel* can request data from the *Model* or update it.
- This is a one-way relationship from the *ViewModel's* perspective but may involve callbacks or completion handlers for asynchronous operations.

3. **Model**
- Contains the essential data but does not have direct knowledge of the *View* or *ViewModel*.
- It might include business rules or data manipulation methods.

### TVMazeServiceKit Packages
- Within this package, a distinct module named *TVMazeServiceKit* has been introduced to centralize and manage reusable data managers utilized across various parts of the application. By organizing the shared managers in this manner, it promotes consistency, enhances maintainability, and simplifies the development process by allowing developers to easily access and utilize these components throughout the project. This modular approach fosters cleaner and more efficient code architecture, facilitating smoother collaboration among team members and ensuring a cohesive user experience across different features.
